To create a react file there are many ways
npm -> node packet manager (used to install libraries)
npx -> node packet executer  (not intall libraries but use them)

1)
npx create-react-app filename 

 (Not used widely as it takes time to create as it install large bundles which may not be required by the developer )

Here create-react-app is a utility (software) to create react app

2)
Using custom build process using vite or parcel

npm create vite@latest
